#Null Hypothesis
* There is no relationship between consumption of contaminated water and presentation with gastroenteritis.

#Alernative Hypothesis
* Consumption of contaminated water causes gastroenteritis.

#Statistical Test
* Pearson's Chi-sqaure test & Fischer's Exact Test
* X-squared = 74.925, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16

###Test Asumptions:
* random samping
* independent observations
* large sample size
* discrete probablity in observed frequencies within the table can be estimated by the continuous X^2^ distribution

#Outcome Analysis
* The p-value indicates that a relationship exists between the amount of contaminated water consumed and whether or not and idividual presented with gastroenteritis. Fischer's Exact test states that the alternative hypothesis is two-sided.
